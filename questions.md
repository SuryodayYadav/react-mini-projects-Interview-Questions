Great question, Suryoday 🔥
This is **exactly** how senior frontend engineers prepare.

Below is a **MICRO → MACRO React roadmap** with **50 mini-projects**, designed to help you write **industry-level React code** and confidently answer **interview design + architecture questions**.

Think of this as **DSA for React Architecture**.

---

## 🧩 LEVEL 1 — MICRO PROJECTS (Foundations)

> Focus: hooks, state, events, accessibility, clean components

1. Counter with `useReducer`
2. Accessible Accordion (keyboard + ARIA)
3. Modal with focus trap & ESC close
4. Debounce search input (custom hook)
5. Throttle scroll listener
6. Controlled vs uncontrolled form
7. Password strength checker
8. Toggle theme (light/dark)
9. Stopwatch with pause/resume
10. Tabs using Compound Components
11. Tooltip with portal
12. Toast notification system
13. Dropdown with outside click handling
14. Pagination logic hook
15. File upload preview component

🎯 **Interview focus**

* Why `useReducer` over `useState`
* Accessibility
* Custom hooks design

---

## 🧱 LEVEL 2 — COMPONENT PATTERNS (Reusable UI)

> Focus: composition, reusability, performance

16. Data Table with sorting & filtering
17. Virtualized list (performance)
18. Infinite scroll component
19. Reusable Form Builder
20. Stepper / Wizard component
21. Calendar date picker
22. Drag & drop list
23. Rating component (stars)
24. Skeleton loader system
25. Responsive navbar

🎯 **Interview focus**

* Component API design
* `memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`
* Composition vs inheritance

---

## 🔗 LEVEL 3 — DATA & SIDE EFFECTS

> Focus: real-world async patterns

26. API service layer abstraction
27. Error boundary implementation
28. Retry + exponential backoff hook
29. Optimistic UI update
30. Polling + cleanup logic
31. Auth token refresh mechanism
32. Cache API responses
33. Role-based UI rendering
34. Global loading manager
35. Feature flag system

🎯 **Interview focus**

* Side-effect handling
* Separation of concerns
* Error handling strategy

---

## 🏗 LEVEL 4 — APPLICATION SCALE PROJECTS

> Focus: architecture, folder structure, state management

36. Authentication system (login/signup)
37. Dashboard layout with permissions
38. Notification center
39. Settings page with preferences
40. Multi-language app (i18n)
41. State management without Redux
42. Context + reducer based store
43. Micro-frontend ready shell
44. Route-based code splitting
45. Analytics event tracker

🎯 **Interview focus**

* App structure
* Context vs Redux
* Performance optimization

---

## 🏢 LEVEL 5 — MACRO (ENTERPRISE-GRADE PROJECTS)

> These are **resume + system design projects**

46. E-commerce frontend (cart, checkout)
47. Admin dashboard (CRUD + charts)
48. Interview practice platform (like LeetCode UI)
49. Real-time chat UI (WebSocket)
50. SaaS product dashboard (Stripe-style)

🎯 **Interview focus**

* Architecture decisions
* Scalability
* Trade-offs

---

## 🧠 HOW TO BUILD EACH PROJECT (Industry Style)

For **every mini-project**, document:

```txt
✔ Problem statement
✔ Component breakdown
✔ State ownership
✔ Custom hooks used
✔ Performance considerations
✔ Accessibility
✔ Trade-offs
```

---

## 📁 Recommended Folder Structure

```txt
src/
 ├─ components/
 ├─ hooks/
 ├─ pages/
 ├─ services/
 ├─ store/
 ├─ utils/
 ├─ constants/
 ├─ types/
```

---

## 🔥 Interview Cheat Code

If you build **15–20 from this list properly**, you can confidently answer:

* “How do you architect a React app?”
* “How do you manage state at scale?”
* “How do you avoid unnecessary re-renders?”
* “How do you write reusable components?”

---

## 🎯 Suggested Next Step (Very Important)

I recommend this **exact order**:

1️⃣ Accordion (compound component)
2️⃣ Modal (accessibility + portals)
3️⃣ Custom data-fetching hook
4️⃣ Form builder
5️⃣ Dashboard app

If you want, next I can:

* 🧠 **Design one project end-to-end (with folder structure + code)**
* 🔁 Convert these into **interview Q&A**
* 🚀 Map React projects to **Spring Boot microservices backend**

Just tell me which one you want to start with.
